        <p>I'm an 18 year old  freshman College student that's going to SUNY New Paltz and my major is Computer Science for the moment, I have a background with coding and Psychology but I've been studying psychology much longer than I've been coding. I've only really code with Python but i wanted to learn C++ and Java since they're important for moving forward. I don't really know too much of what i'll do after college or if things go south up ahead but if i had to just say something, I'll probally work my way through whatever hardship i found myself into and try to make things better.</p>
